## Main body

To either request support or contribute findings to the project, our Discord Server can be found [here](https://discord.gg/EF3Jq57jQv). 
If you see me in game say hi! My username is "I want to eat flowers!"

### Donating
I've probably put *at least* five hundred hours into working on this project. I want it to be free forever, but I'm dirt poor and if you would like to donate as a means of showing thanks I have a kofi here! https://ko-fi.com/sqooky and I will love you forever. You will be added to the list of donors and I will probably read your name at the end of the next yt videos I make.

## Base Instructions
To install the performance config replace the gameinfo.gi in ``steamapps/common/deadlock/game/citadel`` with the one downloaded from this repository.
**There is a video tutorial** for installation available [here](https://youtu.be/TbjLbQVN2kE)

# FAQ
If you get an error message like FATAL ERROR: ... <something>.xml that means a old/outdated/broken mod is responsible.

Solutions:

    Delete the mods: go to steamapps/common/Deadlock/game/citadel/addons and delete all its contents.
    Disable mod loading: open steamapps/common/Deadlock/game/citadel/gameinfo.gi and search for "citadel/addons". add // in front of that line (in front of Game): // Game "citadel/addons". Then make sure to start through steam, not a mod manager.
        this allows you to keep your mod folder intact
- "Will this effect my mods?"
No. Every config file included in this repo has mod support already added.
- "How do I find a value in the config"  
Press ctrl+f in your text editor and type in the string you want.  
- "How do I restore a value to default"  
Comment it out.  
- "What does commenting mean"  
To comment a line put ``//`` at the front of the line. It will make it not executed by the config.  
- "Why are my characters dark in the portraits on the end screen and shop"  
``lb_enable_dynamic_lights`` set it to ``true``
- "Why are buildings popping in and out"  
``r_farz`` or ``r_mapextents`` comment them out.  
- "How do I change my fov"  
``citadel_camera_hero_fov`` or ``r_aspectratio`` Comment this out or lower the value.  
- "The config broke this patch"  
The gameinfo.gi gets overwritten every major update. You need to manually replace it again.  
- "I can't see boxes past a certain distance"  
``r_size_cull_threshold "0.7"``
- "I can't see trooper healthbars past a certain distance"  
Change the values ``r_size_cull_threshold`` ``sc_fade_distance_scale_override``
- "Can't see the Doorman ult indicator"  
Set ``cl_ragdoll_limit`` to `` "-1"``
- "There's holes in victor and paige at certain angles"  
Comment out ``sc_screen_size_lod_scale_override`` or increase the value.
- "Sinners lights are little triangles"  
Comment out ``sc_screen_size_lod_scale_override`` or increase the value.  
- "I'm using boot's/kaiz's config and I can't see heros in shop or in the end screen"  
``citadel_portrait_world_renderer_off`` comment it out or set it to false  
- "I'm using boot's/kaiz's config and I can't see lash's ground slam"  
``r_drawdecals`` comment it out or set it to true  
- "Can't see blast vent wind at range"  
``sc_fade_distance_scale_override`` comment it out  
- "I'm using the maxfps testing config/boot's/kaiz's config and I can't read the inworld text (soul pickups, bridge buffs, statue buffs, etc)  
Comment out or increase the value of ``citadel_in_world_item_panel_dpi``
- When I aim down sights (right click) as rem or venator my camera moves down.
``citadel_camera_use_vmdl_flatten_vertical`` Comment it out or set it to ``true``
- "I am using Kaizuchaneru's config and my modded skin makes Billy's Blasted look weird"
``r_citadel_npr_force_solid_outline`` Set this to false. 
- "The puddle beneath neutrals, the rank display, the statues in spawn, and the spirit urn all now are rainbowy and look super weird."
``r_citadel_npr_force_solid_outline`` Set this command to false.
- "I am using Kaizuchaneru's config and my character's clothes don't move sometimes.
``cloth_update`` set it to 1
- "Why does McGinnis' wall turn into a tombstone for a second"
Comment out these from under SceneEffects ``CMTAtlasHeight`` ``CMTAtlasWidth``

## How do I Manually Add Convars

To manually add convars you need to open up gameinfo.gi, ctrl+f ``convars`` and paste the commands after the ``{`` 
When adding convars manually make sure to not remove `` rate {`` or place them in its bracket, as it will cause the game to not launch
```
Convars {
//you want your convars to begin on this line-


// And end on this one.
rate {
```

# "THE MAP IS WEIRD AND DARK AFTER INSTALLING THE CONFIG"
Lower your ingame shadow settings to medium or low
# Mod Support
Every variation of the config included in this repository has mod support added. For those who wish to remove or add it back in, remove ``Game                citadel/addons`` From the searchpaths bracket.

# Pretty Important Announcement
In the patch from a while back there was a change to citadel_main_english.txt stating "Unable to enter matchmaking while any party member has changes to ConVars in Gameinfo.gi or is running Tools-Mode." At present moment it is not fully implemented.
That aside it is possible that in the future valve will properly implement this, thus restricting the usage of convars ingame. Until that happens (and most likely after it happens) I will still be working on this project. 

Until then you should consider writing [a forum post](https://forums.playdeadlock.com/) going "heyyyyyy I'm scared I won't be able to play this game at ~+60fps if cvars are properly disabled" as it is the most direct way to provide feedback to the developers
