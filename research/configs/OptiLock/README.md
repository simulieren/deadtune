# Base Instructions
	Directions: 
        Replace your gameinfo.gi ENTIRELY with the FPS Config of your choice in the provided file at steamapps/common/deadlock/game/citadel (OptiLock Max FPS Preset is recommended)

        Open the provided video.txt and copy all of the text

        Open your video.txt in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Deadlock\game\citadel\cfg

        Delete everything under deviceid 

        Paste what you copied earlier

        Save and Exit and you are done. (Your game MAY crash on first load, this is normal. Just open the game again. If it continues to crash you did something wrong and will need to try again)

You *MUST* do both or else you will have a very weird looking game or you may **crash**.

*[Your video.txt file should look like this before game launch](https://imgur.com/a/3o2FJ1u)*

**IF YOU RAISE YOUR setting.r_texture_stream_mip_bias past 4 IN VIDEO.TXT, YOU WILL HAVE TO INSTALL THE SINNER'S LIGHT FIX MOD. THIS IS INCLUDED IN THE ESSENTIAL FIXES FOLDER.**

# Optional Optimizations

[Windows and Linux Optimization Project](https://github.com/dacooderr/Windows-and-Linux-Optimization)

**<ins>Improve 1% lows</ins>**: Using RTSS and locking your fps in-game to 3 fps under your refresh rate and turning on Vsync + Gsync (Or AMD Freesync/Intel Adaptive-Sync) can significantly improve your 1% lows.
[Download Here](https://www.guru3d.com/download/rtss-rivatuner-statistics-server-download/).

**<ins>Process Lasso</ins>**: 
Using this in conjunction with everything can further improve 1% lows by giving Deadlock high priority and messing with the CPU affinity according to your Processor.
[Download Here](https://bitsum.com/).

You can find a tutorial on how to utilize Process Lasso [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXpnCqXxwz8).

# FAQ

- "How do I find a command in the config"  
Press ctrl+f in your text editor and type in the command you want to change.  

- "How do I restore a value to default"  
Removing the command entirely is the easiest way

- "How do I change my fov"
``r_aspectratio``
``citadel_camera_hero_fov``
 	+ Adjust these two values to your liking.  

- "The config broke this patch"  
The gameinfo.gi gets overwritten in some patches, even small ones. You may need to manually replace it again.

- "My game is crashing"
You may have to completely delete and reinstall the game by uninstalling and making sure there are no leftover files from previous configs or mods. (some mods replace original files and cause files to persist when doing a simple Steam Uninstall.
Make sure to delete the Deadlock file **ENTIRELY.** - [Example](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1494139617090469980/1494139617249726535/delete.jpg?ex=6a1052b4&is=6a0f0134&hm=0fda70acb60a96ed746ed56c0817f357298c2fbec4b05b678b6cab25e54f09dc&=&format=webp)
